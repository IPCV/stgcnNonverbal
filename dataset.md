title: The Circle of Life
subtitle: An acappella singing voice montage with ground-truth sources
---

<div class="lead mb-0" align="justify">
Evaluating algorithms in real world examples is an important step to verify those work in real challenging situations. 
We recorded an amateur singer to compose a 6-voice montage which permits to evaluate in real world examples but having ground-truth sources to compare with.

<br><br>

To do so, we have chosen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Life">The Circle of Life</a> song. The reasons are:
<ul>
    <li>Two-languages song, english and zulu.</li>  
    <li>Humming-like sounds which are more challenging than separating lyrics.</li>  
    <li>Synchronized voices and chorals which are slightly delayed on time.</li>
</ul>

We also add an instrumental backtrack in order to provide musical coherence and sonority.
