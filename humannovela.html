 <h1>Human NonVerbal Language Dataset</h1>
    </br>
    </br>
    The goal of Human NonVerbal Language Dataset (<b>HumanNoVeLa </b>) is to gather data related to 
    human body patterns that can hopefully be used to study nonverbal communication characteristics.
    </br>
    </br>
    A context in which nonverbal information play a major role is the financing of young firms.
    We videotaped 218 entrepreneurs in a real investment setting, and surveyed independent raters 
    to obtain perceptions of each speaker on six individual characteristics: 
    passion, dominance, trustworthiness, competence, attractiveness and openness 
    (those that prior literature examines in relation to financing contexts).
    </br>
    </br>
    HumanNoVeLa offers speaker's 3D skeleton videos extracted from those videos and their
    respective ratings on perceptions of speakers' personal characteristics.
